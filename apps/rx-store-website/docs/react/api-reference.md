Rx Store uses [tsdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc) comments throughout it's source code, describing it's API. The code is intended to be as "self documenting" as possible, these comments are human readable and also should show up in your editor integration if using Typescript, making the API easy to use

If you wish to browse a higher level HTML API Reference, [you can browse our machine generated HTML view of the API Reference](../../api-react/modules/_libs_react_src_index_.html) which is generated using [typedoc](http://typedoc.org/).
