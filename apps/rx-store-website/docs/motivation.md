Existing "reactive" stores exist, built with RxJS, but all were all inherently built with "state" instead of "streams", or uses a single global event emitter with a single root state that changes on every update, like ngRx store or redux-observable.

In larger redux apps, even with memoization, running every mapStateToProps on every action can be expensive. It is especially problematic if you have lots of things happening over time. For these use cases, it is better to deal with "streams" instead of with "state".
