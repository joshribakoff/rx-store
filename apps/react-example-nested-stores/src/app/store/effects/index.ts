 * and start it with 0. We "next"  or emit the values onto the count$
 * subject.
 *
 * These global side effects are subscribed when the top level
 * Rx Store <Provider /> is first mounted, and unsubscribed for you
 * when that component unmounts.
 *
 * You also have the option to make your subscriptions not global,
 * by accessing the context value directly in your components, and
 * subscribing. See the <Provider /> component for an example.
