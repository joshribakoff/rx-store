/**

 * of the **SpawnEffect** typing get the mapped type's with the sources &
 * sinks typings. Example:
 *
 * SpawnEffect<AppStoreValue>.
 *
 *
 * The **function signature** specified by this typing is also itself
 * a generic. This is so that if you want to spawn an inner
 * effect that projects values onto the outer effect that spawned it,
 * you can type check that the inner effect projects the correct type of
 * value back, and to ensure that if the inner effect is flattened back into
 * the outer effect, the outer effect has access to the correct typings:
 *
 *  spawnEffect<boolean>(() => from(...).mapTo(true))
